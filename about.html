				<h3>About</h3>
				<p>Hello, my name is Johan Ferreras, a student at High School of Language and Innovation in the Bronx. I am originally from the Dominican Republic and ever since I was little I have enjoyed playing sports and fidgeting with computers.</p>
				<p>Ever since I came to the United States, I have tried my best to exceed in everything I do, even if that means going to sleep at 2:00 A.M. This is because in the high school I attend students are taught to teach themselves and to work in teams. As a result, I have become the type of person that does not ask for help unless I have tried hard enough. Thanks to this, I am proud to say that I know how to teach myself as long as I have the resources required.</p>
				<p>During the summer of 2012 I traveled to South Korea since I was studying Korean language in my school. During this trip I got to see how beautiful the unknown can be! I am Dominican so my culture is totally different from the Korean culture. Coincidentally, my name is originated from Korean, which I did not find out until everyone that asked for my name had to ask the awkward question, "Are you Korean?"</p>
				<p>I am a student athlete as well. I play Bowling and Volleyball for school teams, while I play basketball and baseball outside of the school as a hobby. I really enjoy working out and anything that means pushing my limits in some way. I take Hip-Hop classes as well, having performed at my school three times and once at Lehman College for the Festival of the Arts.</p>
				<p>In the past year I have gotten myself more familiarized with technology and entrepreneurship. Therefore I participated in the event Start-up Weekend, which helped me realized the passion I felt for entrepreneurship. If I had to describe my experience it would be AWESOME since I felt like a real "problem solver". In addition, I had the opportunity to work with other people under time pressure and have the hands-on experience of coming up with an idea and actually working to develop it. Also, I joined the Generation Tech 2014 summer program, where I have learned more about entrepreneurship and how to properly start a business.</p>
